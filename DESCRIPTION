Description: Provides a consistent C++ class interface for reading
        and writing data from and to a variety of commonly used
        matrix types. Ordinary matrices and several sparse/dense
        Matrix classes are directly supported, third-party S4
        classes may be supported by external linkage, while all
        other matrices are handled by block processing via R.
